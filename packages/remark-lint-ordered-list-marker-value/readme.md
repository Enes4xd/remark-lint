Warn when the list item marker values of ordered lists violate a given
style.

Options: `'single'`, `'one'`, or `'ordered'`, default: `'ordered'`.

When set to `'ordered'`, list item bullets should increment by one,
relative to the starting point.
When set to `'single'`, bullets should be the same as the relative starting
point.
When set to `'one'`, bullets should always be `1`.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify)
retains the number of the first list item bullet, and by default
increments the other items.
Pass
[`incrementListMarker: false`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionsincrementlistmarker)
to not increment further list items.

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm]:
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `imported`ed instead of `required`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-value
```

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintOrderedListMarkerValue`.

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "lint",
+    "lint-ordered-list-marker-value",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-ordered-list-marker-value readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 import {remark} from 'remark'
 import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
 import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
 import remarkLintOrderedListMarkerValue from 'remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-value'

 remark()
   .use(remarkLint)
+  .use(remarkLintOrderedListMarkerValue)
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**')
   .then((file) => {
     console.error(reporter(file))
   })
```
